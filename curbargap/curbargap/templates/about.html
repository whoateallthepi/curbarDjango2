    curbargap.info was developed to show the data from our 'homebrew' farm 
    weather station. In this intial version you can 
    <a href ='/weather/reading/totals'> search weather 
    records</a> for Curbar, as well as some data from previous sitings just
    down the valley in Grindleford, and Blackheath in London. 

</p>
    <p>I use this data every day on the farm. So I hope it is of some 
     interest elsewhere

    </p>
    <p> You can also view <a href='/weather/forecast/summary/351418'>
        summary</a> and <a href='/weather/forecast/full/511'>
        full weather forecasts</a> for the area. These come from the 
    Met Office's 'Datapoint' API. These are something else I use daily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coming soon we should have some weather satellite pictures from another
        DIY project &ndash; our NOAA satellite receiver.
